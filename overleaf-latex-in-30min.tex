  \item The text in the entries may be of any length.

% add math equation inline (use one of these delimiters: \( ... \), $ ... $ or \begin{math} ... \end{math})
Albert Einstein discovered the equation $E=mc^2$ in 1905.


% add math equation, numbered and unnumbered, in display mode (use one of these delimiters: \[ ... \], \begin{displaymath} ... \end{displaymath} or \begin{equation} ... \end{equation})
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
\[ E=mc^2 \]
discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}

Subscripts in math mode are written as $a_b$ and superscripts are written as $a^b$. These can be combined an nested to write expressions such as

\[ T^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_p}_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_q} = T(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_p},e_{j_1},\dots,e_{j_q}) \]
 
We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$. Limits are placed on integrals using superscripts and subscripts:

\[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} \]

Lower case Greek letters are written as $\omega$ $\delta$ etc. while upper case Greek letters are written as $\Omega$ $\Delta$.

Mathematical operators are prefixed with a backslash as $\sin(\beta)$, $\cos(\alpha)$, $\log(x)$ etc.


% paragraphs and newlines
Hit the "Enter" key twice (to insert a double blank line) to start a new paragraph.
%To start a new line without actually starting a new paragraph insert a \textit{break line} point, this can be done by \\ (a double backslash as in the example) or the \textbf{\newline} command. 
%The recommended method to "simulate" paragraphs with larger spacing between them is to keep using double blank lines to create new paragraphs without any \\, and then add \usepackage{parskip} to the preamble.
